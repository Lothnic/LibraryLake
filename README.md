## What I Want to Achieve with This

- I want to make this a Data Engineering project that would also have a book recommender system. 
- I want the main focus for this project to be the Data part rather than the ML part(nice to have).
- Things to achieve with this
    - Data Ingestion using Airflow or using Openlibrary DataDumps.
    - Data Storage in S3 or any other cloud storage.
    - Data Processing using Airflow(again).
    - Do data analytics on the books data and have a tableau or powerBI dashboard(preffered).
    - Build a recommender system based on genre
